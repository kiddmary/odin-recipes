    <p><em><h1>Description</h1><h4>Staghorn sumac is a common "weed" that produces tiny clusters of edible berries. The berries are coated by malic acid, which gives these berries their sour flavor (hence why staghorn sumacs are sometimes referred to as "lemonade trees").</h4></em></p>

    <p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb fresh-picked staghorn sumac berries clusters</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h1>Steps</h1></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Process the staghorn sumac clusters by removing berries and placing into a separate container/bowl. You may want to use gloves here, since the berries can stain skin/clothes pink or red.</li>
            <li>In a mason jar, layer sumac berries and salt on top of one another. Continue layering until you get to the top of the jar.</li>
            <li>Seal the jar and leave in a cool, dark area for 3 months.</li>
            <li>After 3 months, the berries will be cured. Working in batches, process the berries in a spice grinder. This should produce a pink or red-colored smooth salt.</li>
            <li>Scoop ground sumac salt into small containers and give away to friends, family and strangers, or use to sprinkle on top of salads, yoghurt, soups, or anything else.</li>
        </ol>
