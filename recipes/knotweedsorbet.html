    <h1>Japanese Knotweed Sorbet</h1>

    <p><em><h1>Description</h1><h4>Japanese knotweed has a reputation for being "invasive", but do you think people would really consider this so if they knew that it was tasty? It tastes similar to rhubarb, which is why it can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.</h4></em></p>

    <p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb fresh-picked Japanese knotweed shoots picked in the springtime</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized Asian pear</li> 
            <li>1 cup cane sugar or other sweetener</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger root</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h1>Steps</h1></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly chop the knotweed into 1/2 inch rounds.</li>
            <li>Dice the Asian pear.</li>
            <li>Place chopped knotweed and pear into a bowl and add cornstarch, spices and ginger root. Mix until the fruit is coated evenly. Add sugar and mix until evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture into a sauce pan and add the water. Heat until the mixture is bubbling and thickened.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat and let cool slightly, and then use either an immersion blender or stand blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Place mixture into the refrigorator and let cool for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Transfer to an ice cream maker and spin until thickened, around 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a freeze-friendly container and let cure for about 2-4 hours. Serve with a fresh sprig of mint or dollop or fresh-whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
